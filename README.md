---
Smart Forms is a Typescript-based [React](https://reactjs.org/) forms web application currently ongoing development by [CSIRO's Australian e-Health Research Centre](https://aehrc.csiro.au/) as part of the Primary Care Data Quality project funded by the Australian Government Department of Health.

The web app is intended to demonstrate the use of [HL7 FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) specifications, such as the [Questionnaire](https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) and [QuestionnaireResponse](https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html) resources, the Structured Data Capture (SDC) implementation guide, and most notably it leverages [SMART on FHIR capabilities](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) that allows the app to be launched by a primary care Clinical Management System (CMS) and capture standardised health check information for healthcare clients.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
<br/>

**If you are interested in using the form renderer in your React app, a standalone package is published on NPM as [@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer).**

| Modular questionnaires | Allows a questionnaire to be composed of sub-questionnaires which allows for reusability of questionnaire components i.e. a single tab within a form with multiple tabs. Subquestionnaires can be "assembled" to form a complete questionnaire with the **$assemble** operation. | [SDC Modular questionnaires](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/modular.html#modular-questionnaires) |


## Contents

1. The Smart Forms web app. Try it out here: smartforms.csiro.au
2. Implemented operations from the [Structured Data Capture (SDC)](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/) specification:
 - [$populate](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition/Questionnaire-populate)
 - [$assemble](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition/Questionnaire-assemble)
3. A standalone component of the questionnaire renderer published on NPM as [@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer).

## Conformance

Here's the Structured Data Capture (SDC) conformance sheet for the Smart Forms app:
https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/blob/main/Conformance.md


## Usage

### Running on a SMART CMS client (the preferred way)

1. Open https://launch.smarthealthit.org/ (or your own SMART on FHIR enabled CMS) in a browser.
2. Set the **App Launch URL** at the bottom of the page as `https://smartforms.csiro.au/launch` and launch app.

### Running in an unlaunched state

This method of running the app does not allow you to save responses as it is not connected to a CMS client.

1. Open https://smartforms.csiro.au in a browser.
2. You would have access to some pre-defined local questionnaires

NOTE: The app will not be able to view or save responses as it is not connected to a CMS client.

## Configuration

### Environment

The default configuration is set to:
```
# Ontoserver endpoint for $expand operations
# To run your own Ontoserver instance, contact us at https://ontoserver.csiro.au/site/contact-us/ontoserver-contact-form/
VITE_ONTOSERVER_URL=https://tx.ontoserver.csiro.au/fhir

# Questionnaire-hosting FHIR server
VITE_FORMS_SERVER_URL=https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir

# Debug mode - set to true in dev mode
VITE_SHOW_DEBUG_MODE=false

# SMART App Launch scopes and launch contexts
# It will be necessary to tweak these variables if you are connecting the app to your own SMART on FHIR enabled CMS/EHR
VITE_LAUNCH_SCOPE=launch/patient patient/*.read offline_access openid fhirUser
VITE_LAUNCH_CLIENT_ID=smart-forms

```

In development mode, create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/smart-forms-app` directory and tweak the environment variables as needed.



### Run app locally

1. Clone this Git source repository onto your local machine from https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms.

2. Install dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

3. Change directory into the directory containing the Smart Forms app.

```sh
cd apps/smart-forms-app
```

4. Start the local server.

```sh
npm start
```

5. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms#usage) but replace https://smartforms.csiro.au/launch with http://localhost:5173/launch
