---
Smart Forms is a Typescript-based [React](https://reactjs.org/) forms web application currently ongoing development by [CSIRO's Australian e-Health Research Centre](https://aehrc.csiro.au/) as part of the Primary Care Data Quality project funded by the Australian Government Department of Health.

The web app is intended to demonstrate the use of [HL7 FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) specifications, such as the [Questionnaire](https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) and [QuestionnaireResponse](https://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html) resources, the Structured Data Capture (SDC) implementation guide, and most notably it leverages [SMART on FHIR capabilities](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html) that allows the app to be launched by a primary care Clinical Management System (CMS) and capture standardised health check information for healthcare clients.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

**If you are interested in using the form renderer in your React app, an NPM library is published at [@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer).**

## Conformance

Here's the Structured Data Capture (SDC) conformance sheet for the Smart Forms app:
https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/blob/main/Conformance.md


## Usage

### Running on a SMART CMS client (the preferred way)

1. Open https://launch.smarthealthit.org/ (or your own SMART on FHIR enabled CMS) in a browser.
2. Set the **App Launch URL** at the bottom of the page as `https://smartforms.csiro.au/launch` and launch app.

### Running in an unlaunched state

This method of running the app does not allow you to save responses as it is not connected to a CMS client.

1. Open https://smartforms.csiro.au in a browser.
2. You would have access to some pre-defined local questionnaires

NOTE: The app will not be able to view or save responses as it is not connected to a CMS client.

## Local Development
Refer to [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on local development and running.
