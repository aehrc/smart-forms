# Change log for alpha releases

This log documents significant changes for [@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer's alpha releases](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer). This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This changelog only includes changes from version 1.0.0-alpha.1 onwards. For stable releases, refer to the main [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

WARNING: Alpha releases are not stable and may contain breaking changes. Changes are also most likely to be undocumented.

## sdc-template-extract [1.0.8] - 2025-08-29
#### Added
- Fix $extract filtering logic when comparing extracted resource with comparison resource (for modified-only usage). Fixed https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/1507.

## [1.0.0-alpha.95] - 2025-08-20
#### Fixed
- Various TypeScript-related bug fixes.
- In the autocomplete component, when the input is less than 2 characters, an info icon will be displayed at the right end.

## [1.0.0-alpha.94] - 2025-08-20
#### Fixed
- Add enableColorScheme at ScopedCssBaseline for native light/dark alignment with parent app i.e. native scrollbars, native focus rings, etc.
  Note that this doesn't provide you with dark mode. for that, you need to wrap `<BaseRenderer>` with your own light/dark-mode enabled `<ThemeProvider>`. See https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/ for more details.

## [1.0.0-alpha.93] - 2025-08-19
#### Changed
- Remove MUI GlobalStyles (which overrides the parent app) with ScopedCssBaseline in RendererThemeProvider. This sets a baseline for the renderer's MUI styles without affecting the parent app's styles.

## [1.0.0-alpha.92] - 2025-08-15
#### Changed
- Changed "questionnaire-item-text-hidden" custom extension to use the "https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/<extension_name>" convention. Affected extensions:

| Old Extension URL                                                                 | New Extension URL                                                                                                                                                 |

- Added backwards compatibility for custom extensions defined in Smart Forms.
  Both URLs "https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/<extension_name>" and "https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/<extension_name>" will work for the custom extensions listed below.

## sdc-assemble [2.0.2] - 2025-08-15
#### Fixed
- Handle axios-based FetchResourceCallback calls correctly, for both happy and sad paths (res.data).
- Fix TypeScript issues in type predicates.
- When resolving subquestionnaire canonical URLs, enforce in the root questionnaire (returns OperationOutcome if not present), otherwise if it's a recursive resolution within subquestionnaires (for sub-subquestionnaires), be more lenient by returning an empty array.

## [1.0.0-alpha.91] - 2025-08-11
#### Changed
- Remove Iconify dependency and replaced them with MUI icons. This affects the next/previous tab and page buttons.

## sdc-template-extract [1.0.7] - 2025-08-11
#### Added
- Allow handling of non-Error exceptions when evaluating FHIRPath expressions. Reason: fhirpath.js might not type exceptions as Error objects correctly.

## [1.0.0-alpha.90] - 2025-08-07
#### Added
- Updated sdc-populate to v4.6.2. Changes as follows:
- Make error handling in fhirpath evaluations more lenient (remove e instanceof Error check), due to fhirpath.js async evaluation returning a string error message instead of an Error object which results in the error being muted on development builds (surprising it works on production).
- Remove unnecessary (or even wrong) client-side sorting based on effectiveDates and recordedDate in Observation and Conditions respectively.
- Reduce bundle size by removing tests and tets data from published package.

## [1.0.0-alpha.89] - 2025-08-04
#### Added
- Add support for custom `https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/GroupHideAddItemButton` extension to hide the "Add Item" button in a repeating group or group table item.
  This extension is used when you want to prevent users from adding items to a group, but still want to allow them to edit existing items.

## [1.0.0-alpha.88] - 2025-08-01
#### Fixed
- Resolves an issue where the `useValidationFeedback` hook was incorrectly falling back to a generic error message in a required item and when `requiredItemsIsHighlighted` is false.

## [1.0.0-alpha.87] - 2025-07-31
#### Fixed
- Fixed number of columns shown and widths when a grid group has a hidden item.

## [1.0.0-alpha.86] - 2025-07-30
#### Fixed
- Standardise generic `StandardTextField` to accommodate multiline inputs - so that all fields have the same height. This fixes an issue where adding multiline support (in alpha.82) in text-based fields increases their height.
- Added multiline support to dropdown fields too.

## [1.0.0-alpha.85] - 2025-07-30
#### Changed
- Reverted visual expression update animations to the previous behaviour (Last change was in 1.0.0-alpha.81).

#### Fixed
- Add check for falsy input values in calculatedExpression hook updates to prevent unintended visual calculatedExpression updates when nothing has actually changed.

## [1.0.0-alpha.84] - 2025-07-30
_(WARNING: Possible breaking changes with QuestionnaireStore.itemTypes)_
#### Changed
- Refactor QuestionnaireStore itemTypes to itemMap. Changed from <linkId, qItem.type> to <linkId, Omit<QuestionnaireItem, 'item'>.

#### Fixed
- Refactor `useValidationFeedback` to rely entirely on the QR store’s invalidItems, resolving timing mismatches between inline feedback and global validation state.
- For DateTimeItem and QuantityItem, fix an issue where feedback was always shown — now only shows feedback when `showFeedback=true` (triggered by unfocusing the field).
- When processing target constraints, add a step to filter out invalidItems whose qItem is hidden via questionnaire-hidden or enableWhen.

## [1.0.0-alpha.83] - 2025-07-24
#### Added
- Updated sdc-populate to v4.6.0. Changes as follows:
- Add fhirContext handling when creating $populate input parameters.
- Increase tolerance of isLaunchContext() so that it can handle more launch contexts beyond the ones defined in https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/ValueSet-launchContext.html.
- Add timeoutMs parameter to populateQuestionnaire() input parameters.

## [1.0.0-alpha.82] - 2025-07-23
#### Added
- Add multiline support to non-numeric text field-based components. This allows text to auto-wrap when it exceeds the width of the text field.

## [1.0.0-alpha.81] - 2025-07-17
#### Added
- Added support for calculatedExpressions to `date` and `dateTime` items.

#### Fixed
- Show date and dateTime error messages when parent group is a gtable/grid.

#### Changed
- Due to space constraints for textfield-based items in gtables/grids, expression update animations for textfield-based items are now changed to a faint green glow. Animations are unchanged for radio and checkbox items.

## [1.0.0-alpha.80] - 2025-07-15
_(WARNING: Possible breaking changes with Questionnaire definitions)_
#### Changed
- Changed all instances of custom extensions to use the "https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/*" convention. Affected extensions:

| Old Extension URL                                                                 | New Extension URL                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/minValue-feedback             | https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/minValue-feedback               |
| https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/maxValue-feedback             | https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/maxValue-feedback               |
| https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/required-feedback             | https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/required-feedback               |
| https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/minQuantityValue-feedback     | https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/minQuantityValue-feedback       |
| https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/maxQuantityValue-feedback     | https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/maxQuantityValue-feedback       |


#### Added
- Added support for new custom extension `https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/custom-extension/questionnaire-item-text-hidden` to prevent rendering of item.text in the renderer. This extension is used when you want to specify item.text for metadata purposes but do not want it displayed in the rendered form.

## sdc-template-extract [1.0.6] - 2025-07-16
#### Added
- Allow `getFhirPatchResourceDisplay()` to support non-Bundle resources e.g. patient, user, encounter etc from launch context.

## [1.0.0-alpha.79] - 2025-07-15
_(WARNING: Possible breaking changes)_
#### Removed
- Removed all usages of `showMinimalView`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.78] - 2025-07-15
#### Added
- Added support for renderer-styling usage in Grid tables.

## [1.0.0-alpha.77] - 2025-07-14
#### Added
- Updated sdc-populate to v4.5.0. Changes as follows:
- Add display element to `QR.subject` and `QR.author`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.76] - 2025-07-13
#### Added
- Added parseFhirDateTimeToDisplayDateTime() as a library function that parses a FHIR dateTime to a human-readable format.

## [1.0.0-alpha.75] - 2025-07-10
#### Added
- Updated sdc-populate to v4.4.0. Changes as follows:
- Add support for child items consuming itemPopulationContext to access fhirPathContext.

## [1.0.0-alpha.74] - 2025-07-09
#### Changed
- Changed how re-population works:
- Grid items are now re-populated one by one like regular items instead of being repopulated as a whole. 
- `ItemToRepopulate` interface now contains `sectionItemText` (replaces `heading`), `parentItemText` and `isInGrid`. Items in a grid usually have their item.text as column headings e.g. Value, Date recorded which does not provide much context. In this case, `parentItemText` can be used to provide more context for the item being re-populated.
- A new library function `isItemInGrid()` is added to check if an item is in a grid (if any of its ancestors is a grid item).

## [1.0.0-alpha.73] - 2025-07-08
#### Fixed
- Fix an issue where invalidItems not updated immediately when target constraint is unmet.
- Fix an issue where in the Playground, existing RendererStylingStore state is wiped (and reverts to the default values) when a button that calls `setRendererStylingStore()` is clicked.


## [1.0.0-alpha.72] - 2025-07-01
#### Fixed
- Added getItemTerminologyServerToUse() as a cleaner way to an item to decide which terminology server to use.
- UseQuantityCalculatedExpression() hook now takes into account preferredTerminologyServer when looking up ucum-units.

## [1.0.0-alpha.71] - 2025-06-30
#### Added
- Added observation-based extraction helper functions canBeObservationExtracted() and buildBundleFromObservationArray() as library functions.


## [1.0.0-alpha.70] - 2025-06-26
#### Added
- Added support for answerOptionToggleExpression in answerValueSet dropdowns.

#### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where cursor is not set to "default" when hovering over HTML-readonly checkbox labels
- Fixed an issue where `readOnlyVisualStyle` is set to "readonly", radio and checkbox inputs are not truly disabled when they are disabled via answerOptionsToggleExpressions.

## [1.0.0-alpha.69] - 2025-06-18
#### Fixed
- Move dayjs.extend() localisation and parse format functions to BaseRenderer.tsx so they are immediately invoked.

#### Updated sdc-populate to v4.3.1. Changes as follows:
- In non-repeating QuestionnaireItems, strictly only populate one answer (the first answer), even if initialExpression evaluates to multiple answers.

## [1.0.0-alpha.68] - 2025-06-16
#### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where Observation-based extraction is mapping QR.author to Obs.author (should be Obs.performer).
- Fixed an issue where empty strings in text-based fields are passing validation.

## [1.0.0-alpha.67] - 2025-06-16
#### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where items with dynamicValueSets with expansion coding of 0 will trigger a fallback expansion against their qItem.answerValueSet.

## [1.0.0-alpha.66] - 2025-06-10
#### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where decimal, dateTime, slider, radio button items are not taking up full space in a grid table.

## [1.0.0-alpha.65] - 2025-06-10
#### Fixed
- Added ARIA attributes to various components.
- Updated various components to have a more descriptive ARIA label.
- Various fixes to typography to meet accessibility requirements - font size, font color changes
- Augment XHTML renderings (from Questionnaire definition) by adding `alt` attribute to <img> tags.
- Updated MUI component code segments that will be deprecated soon i.e. updated to slotProps.

### Changed
- Removed `simplebar-react` dependency and all associated custom scrollbar components (`Scrollbar.tsx` and `Scrollbar.styles.ts`). Updated `DashboardNav` to use native scroll behavior instead.
- Downgraded `react-router-dom` from version `7.2.0` to `6.11.2` because `useBlocker` is broken in the later versions.

### Known accessibility issues that will never be fixed:
- [Label text is located before its associated checkbox or radio button element](https://unpkg.com/accessibility-checker-engine@4.0.5/help/en-US/input_label_after.html#%7B%22message%22%3A%22Label%20text%20is%20located%20before%20its%20associated%20checkbox%20or%20radio%20button%20element%22%2C%22msgArgs%22%3A%5B%22%7B0%7D%22%2C%22%7B1%7D%22%2C%22%7B3%7D%22%2C%22%7B4%7D%22%5D%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22VIOLATION%22%2C%22FAIL%22%5D%2C%22reasonId%22%3A%22Fail_2%22%7D)

### Changed
- Changed how additionalVariables in buildForm() (and it's variants) work. Instead of <name, extension obj> which doesn't provide much value,
  it now works more like a fhirPathContext <name, value> where `value` is the evaluated value from fhirpath.evaluate(). additionalVariables likely will come from a pre-population module (like sdc-populate) which then can be injected into the renderer's fhirPathContext.

## [1.0.0-alpha.64] - 2025-06-05
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where cqfExpressions are not evaluated when the QuestionnaireResponse is first initialised.

### Changed
- Changed how additionalVariables in buildForm() (and it's variants) work. Instead of <name, extension obj> which doesn't provide much value, 
  it now works more like a fhirPathContext <name, value> where `value` is the evaluated value from fhirpath.evaluate(). additionalVariables likely will come from a pre-population module (like sdc-populate) which then can be injected into the renderer's fhirPathContext.

## [1.0.0-alpha.63] - 2025-06-05
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where group table cells content is not centre-aligned.

## [1.0.0-alpha.62] - 2025-06-05
### Added
- Added "X" clear buttons to text-based input fields, update renderer to alpha.62.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where items in a group table cell doesn't use all available space.
- Centred group table headers.

## [1.0.0-alpha.61] - 2025-06-05
### Fixed
- Fixed colour differences between readOnly and editable text-based input fields.
- Fixed an issue where group table and grid child items can be edited even when the parent group is readOnly.
- Removed add, remove, drag, check interactions for readOnly group tables.
- Prevent rendering of "Clear" button for radio and checkbox items when they are readOnly.
- Centred cell content in group table and grid table.

## [1.0.0-alpha.58] - 2025-06-03
### Fixed
- Fixed number of columns shown and widths when a group table has a hidden item.
- Updated sdc-populate to v4.3.0. Changes as follows:
- Fixed an [issue](https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/1258) where a repeating group using ItemPopulationContext only looks at the first item in the group to determine the itemPopulationContext used.
- Included author and authored property when creating a QuestionnaireResponse.

## [1.0.0-alpha.57] - 2025-05-27
### Changed
- Changed inline validation messages to be shown when the field loses focus. See [issue](https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/1219).

## [1.0.0-alpha.56] - 2025-05-26
### Added
- Exposed getSectionHeading() as a library function

### Changed
- Use fast-equals deepEqual() instead of lodash.isEqual() for better performance.

## [1.0.0-alpha.55] - 2025-05-07
### Added
- Updated @aehrc/sdc-populate to 4.1.0. It now uses the same removeEmptyAnswers() implementation as the renderer, which is more battle tested.

## [1.0.0-alpha.54] - 2025-05-07
### Fixed
- Dynamic _answerValueSet options now updates consistently.
- Whenever dynamic _answerValueSet options change, the item fields is now cleared consistently.

## [1.0.0-alpha.53] - 2025-05-02

- Refactored a bunch of choice/open-choice checkboxes and radio buttons to make them cleaner and reduce code duplication.

## [1.0.0-alpha.49] - 2025-04-29
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the initial QuestionnaireResponse has empty `item` arrays in `group` items. This was causing client-side and server-side validation errors.

## [1.0.0-alpha.48] - 2025-04-29
### Added
- Added partial accessibility support for checkboxes and radio buttons, notably:
- Read-only elements with role="radiogroup" be given aria-readonly="true"
- Checkboxes has role="checkbox" and if they are read-only elements, aria-readonly="true" as well.
- Prevent the cursor from changing to "pointer" when read-only checkboxes and radio buttons are hovered, ripple effects on interaction are also removed.
- Item labels now have `id` of `'label-' + qItem.linkId`.
- Checkbox FormGroups and RadioGroups have `aria-labelledby` set to the item label id.

## [1.0.0-alpha.47] - 2025-04-14
Note: this version doesn't build properly, use v1.0.0-alpha.48 instead.

## [1.0.0-alpha.46] - 2025-04-11
### Fixed

## [1.0.0-alpha.43] - 2025-04-10
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where quantity unit and comparator dropdown fields are bugging out in read-only mode.

## [1.0.0-alpha.42] - 2025-04-10
_(WARNING: Possible major breaking changes with MUI, MUI theming, Tanstack React Query, SDC-Populate, SDC-Assemble)_
### Changed (See https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/pull/1182#issuecomment-2795771013)
- Upgraded to Material-UI v7. Follow the [migration guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v7/) to update your MUI to v7. [Grid](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/) is especially one to pay attention to.
- Upgraded to React Query v5. Follow the [migration guide](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/migrating-to-v5) to update your React Query to v5.
- All peer dependencies have become dependencies except for `react` and `react-dom`. See https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/1179. This is because Angular and Vue apps consuming this library do not usually have React-specific libraries like MUI or React Query.
- Only supports React 18 and React 19 officially. It might work on React 17, but you might need to do `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` or `npm i --force`.
- SDC-Populate and SDC-Assemble interface changes: `FetchResourceCallback`, `FetchTerminologyCallback`, `FetchResourceRequestConfig`, `FetchTerminologyRequestConfig`.
- It is now a requirement for `FetchResourceRequestConfig` to have a sourceServerUrl as the FHIR server URL to fetch resources from.
- It is now a requirement for `FetchTerminologyRequestConfig` to have a terminologyServerUrl as the FHIR Terminology server URL to fetch terminology from.

### Fixed
- Revert non-readOnly text-based fields to old border colour (MUI default grey-ish).

## [1.0.0-alpha.41] - 2025-04-08
### Changed
- Capped peer React version at ^18.0.0. Reason being there are multiple dependencies that are not compatible with React 19.x.x.
- When reading XHTML class styles, skip stylesheets from other origins

## [1.0.0-alpha.40] - 2025-04-08
### Added
- Added support for HTML readonly `attribute` as an alternative to `disabled` for readOnly items. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly#attribute_interactions for more information.
- You can toggle between these two visual styles/behaviours via the `readOnlyVisualStyle` config in `RendererStylingStore`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.39] - 2025-04-04
### Changed
- Completely refactored removeEmptyAnswers() implementation to work with repeat groups.

### Fixed
- Add support for repeat groups in initialisation of calculatedExpressions.

## [1.0.0-alpha.38] - 2025-04-02
### Added
- Add support for class-based styles for XHTML item._text. See https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/1120#issuecomment-2771327317 for more information.

## [1.0.0-alpha.37] - 2025-04-02

- Fixed an issue where display instructions persists even when the item has an error message.

## [1.0.0-alpha.36] - 2025-04-02
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where SDC itemControl `collapsible` doesn't work with Group Table.

## [1.0.0-alpha.35] - 2025-04-01
### Added
- Implement Parameterised/Dynamic ValueSets
- Proposal: https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/parameterized-valuesets.html
- chat.fhir.org channel: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179202-terminology/topic/Parameterised.20ValueSets/with/509420458

## [1.0.0-alpha.34] - 2025-03-27
### Added
- Implement partial support for header and footer itemControls - header and footer will render properly but will not be sticky.

### Changed
- Allow two methods for defining SDC itemControl `page`:
  1. Standards-based as defined in SDC: https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/CodeSystem-questionnaire-item-control.html#questionnaire-item-control-page
  2. Backwards-compatible way - using it as a "page-container"

## [1.0.0-alpha.33] - 2025-03-27
### Fixed
- Allow `extension` property in valueCodings i.e. `ordinalValue` extension usage. 

## [1.0.0-alpha.32] - 2025-03-27
### Fixed
