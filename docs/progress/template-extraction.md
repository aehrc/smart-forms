# Template-Based Extraction Progress

## Overview
We've been working on improving the template-based extraction functionality, focusing on proper patient information handling and component updates.

## Key Changes Made

### Patient Information Handling
- Updated the `extractTemplateBased` function to properly handle patient information
- Modified the `createBloodPressureObservations` function to include required fields:
  - Added `category` field with vital signs category
  - Added `effectiveDateTime` field with current timestamp

### Component Updates
- Updated components to use `extractionResult` instead of `extractedResource`:
  - `ExtractMenu.tsx`
  - `JsonEditor.tsx`
  - `Playground.tsx`
  - `PlaygroundRenderer.tsx`
  - `StoreStateViewer.tsx`
  - `ExtractedResourceViewer.tsx`

### New Components and Utilities
- Added `TemplateExtractionDebug.tsx` for debugging template extraction
- Created `templateExtraction.ts` utility file
- Added blood pressure template files in `scripts/FhirMappingLanguage/blood-pressure/`

## Current Status
- Template-based extraction is working correctly
- Patient information is properly handled in the extraction process
- Components are updated to use the new store interface
- Debug information is available for troubleshooting

## Next Steps
- Continue testing and refining the template-based extraction
- Add more template examples
- Improve error handling and validation
