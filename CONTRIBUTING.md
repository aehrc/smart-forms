## Reporting issues

Issues can be used to:

* Report a defect
* Request a new feature or enhancement
* Ask a question

New issues will be automatically populated with a template that highlights the
information that needs to be submitted with an issue that describes a defect. If
the issue is not related to a defect, please just delete the template and
replace it with a detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve.

## Creating a pull request

Please communicate with us (preferably through creation of an issue) before
embarking on any significant work within a pull request. This will prevent
situations where people are working at cross-purposes.

A good branching naming convention is `issue/[GitHub issue #]`.

If possible, it is recommended to merge the `main` branch into your branch first before creating a pull request.
