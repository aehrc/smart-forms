# Minimal Demo Renderer App

This app showcases the usage of the `@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer` and `@aehrc/sdc-populate` in a minimal setup. The near-zero styling is intentional to focus on the core functionality.

It also demonstrates the pre-population of questionnaires with just an OAuth2.0 Bearer Token. SMART App Launch is used, but only for obtaining the bearer token.

Bootstrapped with React + TypeScript + Vite template.
