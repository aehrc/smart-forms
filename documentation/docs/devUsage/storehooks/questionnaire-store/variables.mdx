# Variables Usage

Smart Forms supports the `fhirpath` and `x-fhir-query` variable extensions. Each key contains a `Record<linkId, variable>`.

Since the root level (the Questionnaire itself) does not have a linkId, extensions at the root level have a key of `QuestionnaireLevel`.

:::warning

Smart Forms having the `QuestionnaireLevel` key for root-level extensions might actually clash with items that have the same linkId. This is a known issue and will be addressed in the future.

:::

```tsx live
function App() {
  const variables = useQuestionnaireStore.use.variables();

  return (
    <>
      <YourBaseRendererWrapper questionnaire={qCalculatedExpressionBMICalculator} />
      <JsonViewer hookName="variables" data={variables} />
    </>
  );
}
```
