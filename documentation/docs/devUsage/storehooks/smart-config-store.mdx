# Smart Config Store

The SmartConfigStore exposes the following properties:

- **client**
- **patient**
- **user**
- **encounter**

Here's how you use the store hook in your React functional component:

```
import { useSmartConfigStore } from '@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer';

function App() {
  const storeProperty = useSmartConfigStore.use.{insert_property_name_here}();

  return (
    <div>{storeProperty}</div>
  );
}
```

Refer to the [API Reference](/docs/api/smart-forms-renderer/interfaces/SmartConfigStoreType) for more information on each property.

:::warning

The SmartConfigStore doesn't actually do much within the renderer at the moment. It is not tested thoroughly and is retained for backward compatibility purposes.

Terminology endpoints are managed in [TerminologyServerStore](/docs/devUsage/storehooks/terminology-server-store).
If there is a need to expand on functionality of making FHIR calls within the renderer, feel free to [let us know](https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/issues/new).

From a best practice perspective, it is recommended to perform FHIR calls outside of the renderer and pass the pre-populated QuestionnaireResponse into the renderer.
