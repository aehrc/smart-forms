:::note

There are other utilities exposed by the renderer but are not intended for direct use, i.e internal UI components and controls which requires advanced setup.
These are used in the Smart Forms app for it's re-population mechanism.

If you are interested, refer to the [API Reference](/docs/api/smart-forms-renderer) section.

### BuildForm

The `buildForm()` function is used to build the form. It takes a `Questionnaire` resource and other optional properties as arguments.
If a QuestionnaireResponse is not provided, an empty QuestionnaireResponse is set as the initial QuestionnaireResponse.

| Parameter             | Type                          | Description                                                                                                | Required? |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| questionnaire         | FHIR R4.Questionnaire         | Questionnaire to be rendered                                                                               | Required  |
| questionnaireResponse | FHIR R4.QuestionnaireResponse | Pre-populated/draft/loaded QuestionnaireResponse to be rendered                                            | Optional  |
| readOnly              | boolean                       | Applies read-only mode to all items in the form view                                                       | Optional  |
| terminologyServerUrl  | string                        | Terminology server url to fetch terminology. If not provided, the default terminology server will be used. | Optional  |
| additionalVariables   | `Record<string, object>`      | Additional key-value pair of SDC variables `Record<name, variable extension>` for testing                  | Optional  |

### DestroyForm

The `destroyForm()` function is used to clear the form to a clean state. Under the hood, it cleans up the questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse state management stores.

### GetResponse

The `getResponse()` function is used to get the QuestionnaireResponse at its current state.
If no changes have been made to the form, the initial QuestionnaireResponse is returned.

Use this if you are planning to use a button click to get the QuestionnaireResponse.

If you want to get the latest QuestionnaireResponse every time the form is changed, use the [QuestionnaireResponseStore `updatableResponse`](/docs/devUsage/storehooks/questionnaire-response-store/updatable-response) hook.

### RemoveEmptyAnswersFromResponse

The `removeEmptyAnswersFromResponse()` function is used to remove empty/hidden answers from a passed QuestionnaireResponse.

This takes into account `enableWhen`, `enableWhenExpression` extensions, items without `item.answer`, empty `item.answer` arrays and empty strings.
This does not remove items that are hidden by the http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-hidden extension.

This function is generally used before saving, printing or exporting the QuestionnaireResponse to ensure the response is clean.

| Parameter             | Type                          | Description                                                | Required? |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| questionnaire         | FHIR R4.Questionnaire         | Source Questionnaire of the provided QuestionnaireResponse | Required  |
| questionnaireResponse | FHIR R4.QuestionnaireResponse | Filled QuestionnaireResponse                               | Required  |

### BaseRenderer

The `BaseRenderer` component is the main component that renders the form.

It renders the Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse defined in the QuestionnaireStore and QuestionnaireResponseStore state management stores respectively.

[`buildForm()`](/docs/devUsage/renderer-utilities#buildform) used be used in your wrapping component or in an event handler to initialise the form before React renders the `BaseRenderer`.

### SmartFormsRenderer

:::warning

The `SmartFormsRenderer` component is planned for deprecation in the future. As a replacement, library users should create their own wrapper around `BaseRenderer` which includes the `useBuildForm()` hook.

`SmartFormsRenderer` provides a fast and easy way to get started with the renderer, but there is a trade-off around customisation and future extensibility. Using your own wrapper provides the following benefits:

- Allows you to customise your own `@tanstack/react-query` query client if needed. A `useRendererQueryClient()` hook is provided if you want to stick to the default.
- Allows you to customise your own theme using [Material UI Theming](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/). A `RendererThemeProvider` component is provided if you want to stick to the default.
- Allows you to customise your own loading animation.
- In the future if any additional functionalities are exposed via hooks, they can be easily plugged in to your own wrapper.

See [here](https://github.com/aehrc/smart-forms/blob/main/packages/smart-forms-renderer/src/stories/storybookWrappers/InitialiseFormWrapperForStorybook.tsx#L40-L57) for replacement options.
:::

The `SmartFormsRenderer` component is a self-initialising wrapper around the `BaseRenderer` component.
If a QuestionnaireResponse is not provided, an empty QuestionnaireResponse is set as the initial QuestionnaireResponse.

| Parameter             | Type                                                     | Description                                                                                                | Required? |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| questionnaire         | FHIR R4.Questionnaire                                    | Questionnaire to be rendered                                                                               | Required  |
| questionnaireResponse | FHIR R4.QuestionnaireResponse                            | Pre-populated/draft/loaded QuestionnaireResponse to be rendered                                            | Optional  |
| additionalVariables   | `Record<string, object>`                                 | Additional key-value pair of SDC variables `Record<name, variable extension>` for testing                  | Optional  |
| terminologyServerUrl  | string                                                   | Terminology server url to fetch terminology. If not provided, the default terminology server will be used. | Optional  |
| fhirClient            | [FHIRClient](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js) | FHIRClient to perform further FHIR calls (not actually being used in the renderer)                         | Optional  |
| readOnly              | boolean                                                  | Applies read-only mode to all items in the form view                                                       | Optional  |

### RendererThemeProvider

The `RendererThemeProvider` component provides the default renderer theme based on Material UI. It should be wrapped around the `BaseRenderer` component.

If you want to customise the renderer to use your own theme, refer to the [Material UI Theming](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/) documentation.

### UseBuildForm

The `useBuildForm()` hook wraps around the `buildForm()` function and provides self-initialisation of the form via [useLayoutEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect).

The reason why `useLayoutEffect` is used over `useEffect` is because the form needs to be initialised before React renders the `BaseRenderer` component.

This is generally the recommended way to initialise the form in your wrapping component. If you want to initialise the form in an event handler, you can use the `buildForm()` function directly.

### UseRendererQueryClient

The `useRendererQueryClient()` hook provides the default renderer `@tanstack/react-query` query client to perform API calls i.e. fetching terminology.

Note that the renderer uses `@tanstack/react-query` version 4.x.x.

If you want to customise the renderer to use your own query client, refer to the [TanStack Query v4](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient) documentation.

### State Management Hooks

Refer to the [Renderer Store Hooks](/docs/devUsage/storehooks) section for more information on the state management hooks provided by the renderer.
