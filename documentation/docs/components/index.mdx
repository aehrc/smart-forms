# Components

Basic components used in Smart Forms to render FHIR [Questionnaires](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/questionnaire.html).

`Questionnaire.item.type` is used to determine which component to render. Smart Forms is based on the R4 FHIR Specification.

Refer to https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/codesystem-item-type.html for the source of supported item types.

The following section showcases usage basic and advanced examples. Some of the advanced examples can be explored further in the [SDC](/docs/sdc) section.
