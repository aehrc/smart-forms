# Renderer Store Hooks

The renderer uses [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for the state management of the renderer's internals i.e. enableWhen logic, calculatedExpressions, tabs management, terminology server etc.
Zustand stores exposes React hooks to access the store's state.

The renderer uses four state management stores, each for a different purpose:

- **QuestionnaireStore**: Manages the state of the questionnaire and SDC-related logic.
- **QuestionnaireResponseStore**: Manages the state of the current questionnaire response including validation.
- **SmartConfigStore**: Manages a FHIRClient instance for further FHIR calls if needed i.e. `answerExpression` extensions.
- **TerminologyServerStore**: Manages the terminology server url to fetch terminology resources.

The usage examples provided in this section uses the BMI Calculator as its input questionnaire, with the exception of [TerminologyServerStore](/docs/dev/storehooks/terminology-server-store).
As the BMI Calculator does not use all of the available properties, only properties relevant to the questionnaire are shown as examples.

You can use [Playground](https://smartforms.csiro.au/playground) to try them out in real-time.
