# FormChangesHistory Usage

The formChangesHistory is an array of all the changes made to the form. It can be really powerful when you are implementing an undo/redo feature.

It uses the [deep-diff](https://github.com/flitbit/diff) library to calculate changes.

```tsx live
function App() {
  const formChangesHistory = useQuestionnaireResponseStore.use.formChangesHistory();

  return (
    <>
      <YourBaseRendererWrapper questionnaire={qCalculatedExpressionBMICalculator} />
      <JsonViewer hookName="formChangesHistory" data={formChangesHistory} />
    </>
  );
}
```
