# Questionnaire Response Store

The QuestionnaireResponseStore is used to interact with the user response state and input validation.

Refer to the [API Reference](/docs/api/smart-forms-renderer/interfaces/QuestionnaireResponseStoreType) to view all properties.

Here's how you use the store hook in your React functional component.

```
import { useQuestionnaireResponseStore } from '@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer';

function App() {
  const storeProperty = useQuestionnaireResponseStore.use.{insert_property_name_here}();

  return (
    <div>{storeProperty}</div>
  );
}
```
