# QuestionnaireStore

The QuestionnaireStore is used to interact with the form's rendering/behavioural state and FHIRPath-related computed properties. It does not contain any user response data, which is managed by the [QuestionnaireResponseStore](/docs/dev/storehooks/questionnaire-response-store).

Refer to the [API Reference](/docs/api/smart-forms-renderer/interfaces/QuestionnaireStoreType) to view all properties.

Here's how you use the store hook in your React functional component.

```
import { useQuestionnaireStore } from '@aehrc/smart-forms-renderer';

function App() {
  const storeProperty = useQuestionnaireStore.use.{insert_property_name_here}();

  return (
    <div>{storeProperty}</div>
  );
}
```
