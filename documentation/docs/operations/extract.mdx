# StructureMap $extract

This $extract **proof-of-concept** reference implementation is an abstraction on top of an existing StructureMap $transform operation.
We leveraged Brian Postlethwaite's [.NET FHIR Mapping Language engine](https://github.com/brianpos/fhir-net-mappinglanguage/tree/main/demo-map-server) to expose a StructureMap $transform operation on https://proxy.smartforms.io/fhir/StructureMap/$transform.

:::note

This reference implementation is a proof-of-concept. It is highly likely that the underlying implementation will change in the future.

## Usage

Resource(s) can be extracted from a QuestionnaireResponse using a **POST** request to a URL such as:

```http request
https://proxy.smartforms.io/fhir/QuestionnaireResponse/$extract (type-level)
```

#### Parameters

| Name                   | Cardinality | Type     | Documentation                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| questionnaire-response | 1..1        | Resource | The QuestionnaireResponse to extract data from. Used when the operation is invoked at the 'type' level. |

## How it works

The $extract operation is an abstraction on top of an existing StructureMap $transform operation.

#### The underlying $transform

A [$transform](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuremap-operation-transform.html) operation requires two input parameters:

1. `source` - Contains the structure map defining the mapping rules
2. `content` - Contains the data to be transformed (in terms of SDC, this is the QuestionnaireResponse)

The output of $transform is the transformed data, a FHIR resource.

Taking this logic, we can use a StructureMap `$transform` operation to perform the extraction of resources from a QuestionnaireResponse. Let's say we want to extract a bundle containing an Observation resource from a QuestionnaireResponse.
We need a StructureMap that maps the data from the QuestionnaireResponse to the Observation resource. Normally we would write this mapping in [FHIR Mapping Language](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html) and convert it to a StructureMap.

For more information on using the FHIR Mapping Language, refer to https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Mapping+Language. Brian has a really awesome tool that can help you write and test your mappings at https://fhirpath-lab.com/FhirMapper2.

Once we have both the `source` StructureMap and the `content` QuestionnaireResponse, our $transform request body should look roughly like this:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "source",
      "resource": //<insert StructureMap here> -
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "content",
      "resource": //<insert QuestionnaireResponse here> - a filled QR from
    }
  ]
}
```

Relevant resources:

`source`- https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir/StructureMap/extract-bmi

`content`- http://smartforms.csiro.au/fhir/Questionnaire/CalculatedExpressionBMICalculatorPrepop

[//]: # 'turn it into a microservice'

Running the $transform operation will return the transformed data, which in this case is a Bundle resource containing the Observation resource:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry": [
    {
      "request": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "Observation"
      },
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Observation",
        "status": "final",
        "code": {
          "coding": [
            {
              "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
              "code": "60621009",
              "display": "Body mass index"
            }
          ]
        },
        "subject": {
          "reference": "Patient/pat-sf"
        },
        "valueQuantity": {
          "value": 29.55,
          "unit": "kg/m2",
          "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
          "code": "kg/m2"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### The $extract operation

Using the logic above, we can abstract the $transform operation into a $extract operation. The $extract operation requires only one input parameter (or you can just provide the QuestionnaireResponse in the request body):

`questionnaire-response` - Contains the QuestionnaireResponse to extract data from

The provided QuestionnaireResponse should fulfill two criteria:

1. It needs to contain a canonical reference in its `questionnaire` property.

```json
{
  ...
  "questionnaire": "https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/sdc/population/calculated-expression-1|0.1.0",
  ...
}
```

2. The referenced Questionnaire should have a [questionnaire-targetStructureMap](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-targetStructureMap) extension. This extension needs to contain a canonical reference to a StructureMap that maps the data from the QuestionnaireResponse to the desired resource(s).

```json
{
  ...
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-targetStructureMap",
      "valueCanonical": "https://smartforms.csiro.au/docs/StructureMap/extract-bmi"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

The $extract POC implementation defines a definitional repository to resolve Questionnaires and StructureMaps - https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir. See https://hub.docker.com/r/aehrc/smart-forms-extract for more information.

The $extract operation will resolve the referenced Questionnaire + StructureMap, and set the StructureMap as the `source` in the $transform operation. The `content` will be the provided QuestionnaireResponse.

The underlying $transform operation will be executed, and the transformed data will be returned as the output of the $extract operation.

## The $convert operation

Brian's [.NET FHIR Mapping Language engine](https://github.com/brianpos/fhir-net-mappinglanguage/tree/main/demo-map-server) has a handy debug mode that can be activated by adding `debug=true` to the $transform query parameters.
The debug payload contains useful details such as warnings/errors, trace output, the converted StructureMap, and the output resource.

Conveniently, it also accepts both a FHIR Mapping Language map and a StructureMap resource as the `source` input.
This means we can use it as a $convert operation to convert a FHIR Mapping Language map to a StructureMap resource.

```
https://proxy.smartforms.io/fhir/StructureMap/$convert
```

It expects the request headers for the `Content-Type` to be `text/plain`. The request body should contain the FHIR Mapping Language map, and the response will contain the converted StructureMap resource.
