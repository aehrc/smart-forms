# FHIR Operations

Smart Forms provides reference implementations for `$populate` and `$assemble` operations as [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) services to complement the FHIR Questionnaire renderer.
These operations are available as Docker images and can be deployed as microservices.

1. **$populate** (https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir/Questionnaire/$populate)

   A reference implementation of the [SDC Populate Questionnaire](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition-Questionnaire-populate.html) operation, also known as $populate.
   It builds on the [@aehrc/sdc-populate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/sdc-populate) library.

2. **$assemble** (https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir/Questionnaire/$assemble)

   A reference implementation of the [SDC Assemble](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition-Questionnaire-assemble.html) operation, also known as $assemble.
   It builds on the [@aehrc/sdc-assemble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aehrc/sdc-assemble) library.

3. **$extract** (https://proxy.smartforms.io/fhir/QuestionnaireResponse/$extract)

   A **proof-of-concept** reference implementation of the [SDC QuestionnaireResponse Extract](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition-QuestionnaireResponse-extract.html) operation, also known as $extract.

   This $extract POC reference implementation is an abstraction on top of an existing StructureMap $transform operation.
   We leveraged Brian Postlethwaite's [.NET FHIR Mapping Language engine](https://github.com/brianpos/fhir-net-mappinglanguage/tree/main/demo-map-server) to expose a StructureMap $transform operation on https://proxy.smartforms.io/fhir/StructureMap/$transform.
