# Group Rendering

This subsection consists of the group-related advanced rendering extensions.

The extensions that fall under this subsection are:

**From SDC - [Questionnaire Item UI Controls](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/CodeSystem-questionnaire-item-control.html)**

- **gtable** - Group Table
- **grid** - Group Grid
- **tab-container** - Tab Container

### Group Table

Allows questions within the group to be rendered as columns in a table with each group repetition as a row.

A group table provides the following controls:

1. **Add Row** - Adds a new row to the group table.
2. **Remove Item** - Removes the selected row from the group table.
3. **Row checkbox** - Selects row items to be captured in the QuestionnaireResponse. By default, all rows are selected.
4. **Select-all checkbox** - Selects or unselects all rows in the group table.
5. **Row drag indicator** - Allows the user to drag and drop rows for reordering.

#### Basic Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-8-1-2-advanced-control-appearance-item-control-group--g-table-single"
  initialHeight={528}
/>

#### Repeating Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-8-1-2-advanced-control-appearance-item-control-group--g-table-repeats"
  initialHeight={580}
/>

:::note

Having too many columns in a group table can make the form question difficult to read. It is recommended to have a maximum of 4-5 columns in a group table.

:::

### Group Grid

Allows questions within the group to be rendered as a grid. Each row in the grid should refer to a topic/section, with the columns representing the related questions.

Refer to the **grid** section in [Questionnaire Item UI Controls](https://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/CodeSystem-questionnaire-item-control.html) for a detailed explanation in constructing a group grid.

#### Single-row Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-8-1-2-advanced-control-appearance-item-control-group--grid-single-row"
  initialHeight={268}
/>

#### Multi-row Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-8-1-2-advanced-control-appearance-item-control-group--grid-multi-row"
  initialHeight={580}
/>

:::note

Similar to the group table, having too many columns in a group grid can make the form question difficult to read. It is recommended to have a maximum of 4-5 columns in a group table.

:::

### Tab Container

Indicates that the group represents a collection of tabs.

This can be used to create a "tabbed" form, with clickable tabs on the left and the form sections on the right.

[Conditional rendering](/docs/sdc/conditional) can be used to show/hide tabs based on form answers or a pre-filled value i.e. a patient's age.

#### Basic Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-8-1-2-advanced-control-appearance-item-control-group--tab-container"
  initialHeight={564}
/>

#### Conditional Rendering Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-9-1-4-form-behavior-other-control--enable-when-expression-tabs"
  initialHeight={412}
/>
