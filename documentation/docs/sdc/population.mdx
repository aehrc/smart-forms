# Pre-population

Pre-population is a mechanism to pre-fill form questions with information already present in the clinical system. It is a way to reduce the burden on the user to fill in information that is already known.

For a detailed explanation, see the [Form Population](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html) section in the SDC spec. Smart Forms supports [expression-based population](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html#expression-based-population).

The elements/extensions that fall under this category are:

#### Extensions containing pre-population queries:

- [launchContext](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#launchContext)
- [variable](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#variable)
- [x-fhir-query](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#x-fhir-query-enhancements)
- [sourceQueries](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/populate.html#structuremap-based-population)
- [itemPopulationContext](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#itemPopulationContext)

#### Elements/expressions defined at the question to be pre-populated:

- [initial](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#initial)
- [initialExpression](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#initialExpression)
- [calculatedExpression](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#calculatedExpression)

### LaunchContext

Allows information to be passed into the execution environment based on the context in which the Questionnaire is being pre-populated i.e patient, user, encounter, etc.

The passed information is known as "in context" within the launching system, and is subsequently applied in pre-population queries.

#### Example

Below is an example of how a launchContext extension is defined in the questionnaire.
It specifies that the patient in context is to be used to pre-populate the form.

```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-launchContext",
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "name",
      "valueCoding": {
        "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/CodeSystem/launchContext",
        "code": "patient"
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "type",
      "valueCode": "Patient"
    },
    {
      "url": "description",
      "valueString": "The patient that is to be used to pre-populate the form"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the below x-fhir-query variable, `{{%patient.id}}` is a reference to the launchContext extension defined above. During pre-population, the value of `{{%patient.id}}` will be replaced with the actual patient id before the query is executed.

```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/variable",
  "valueExpression": {
    "name": "Condition",
    "language": "application/x-fhir-query",
    "expression": "Condition?patient={{%patient.id}}"
  }
}
```

For usages, refer to [initial](/docs/sdc/population#initial), [initialExpression](/docs/sdc/population#initialexpression), and [calculatedExpression](/docs/sdc/population#calculatedexpression) sections on this page.

### X-FHIR-Query Variable

The variable extension is used to define a variable that is available for use in expressions within the same item and any descendant items.

When the variable is defined using the `application/x-fhir-query` language, it can be used to contain a query that is executed against the FHIR server during pre-population to retrieve the value to be used in the expression.

For more information, refer to http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#x-fhir-query-enhancements.

#### Example

Below is an example of how a variable extension using the `application/x-fhir-query` language is defined in the questionnaire.

It specifies a variable called "Condition" and it's value is to be retrieved by executing the query `Condition?patient={{%patient.id}}` on the launching system.
`{{%patient.id}}` is a reference to a defined launchContext, which will be replaced with the actual patient ID before the query is executed.

After the query is executed, the expression can be consumed by initialExpressions during the pre-population process.

```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/variable",
  "valueExpression": {
    "name": "Condition",
    "language": "application/x-fhir-query",
    "expression": "Condition?patient={{%patient.id}}"
  }
}
```

For usages, refer to [initial](/docs/sdc/population#initial), [initialExpression](/docs/sdc/population#initialexpression), and [calculatedExpression](/docs/sdc/population#calculatedexpression) sections on this page.

### SourceQueries

The sourceQueries extension is used to contain a reference pointing to a [batch/transaction](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#transaction) bundle containing queries to be executed against the FHIR server during pre-population.

According to the SDC spec, the sourceQueries extension is meant to be used in [StructureMap-based population](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html#structuremap-based-population) and not [Expression-based population](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html#expression-based-population).
Smart Forms supports the use of sourceQueries in Expression-based population for backward-compatibility of previously-defined questionnaires.
It is encouraged to use the extensions defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html#expression-based-population to be conformant.

#### Example

Below is an example of how the sourceQueries extension is defined in the questionnaire, and how an initialExpression can consume it.
Note that this uses a expression-based population mechanism.

It specifies a sourceQueries extension which references a contained batch resource called "PrePopQuery".
During pre-processing, `{{%patient.id}}` instances in the batch will be replaced with the actual patient ID before the query is executed.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  // ...
  "contained": [
    {
      "resourceType": "Bundle",
      "id": "PrePopQuery",
      "type": "batch",
      "entry": [
        {
          "fullUrl": "urn:uuid:38a25157-b8e4-42e4-9525-7954fed52553",
          "request": {
            "method": "GET",
            "url": "Observation?code=8302-2&_count=1&_sort=-date&patient={{%patient.id}}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-sourceQueries",
      "valueReference": {
        "reference": "#PrePopQuery"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After the batch query is executed, it can be consumed by initialExpressions during the pre-population process like a regular Bundle resource.

```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
  "valueExpression": {
    "language": "text/fhirpath",
    "expression": "%PrePopQuery.entry[0].resource.entry.resource.value.value"
  }
}
```

### ItemPopulationContext

The itemPopulationContext extension is used to define a context that is available for use in initialExpressions during the pre-population process.
In simple terms, it acts as a variable used to aid in pre-population. It is especially useful for pre-populating repeating groups.

For more information, refer to http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#itemPopulationContext.

#### Example

Below is an example of how the itemPopulationContext extension is defined, and how initialExpressions can consume it.
This is notably an example of pre-populating an [AU Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/) patient's home address repeating group.

```json
{
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-itemPopulationContext",
      "valueExpression": {
        "name": "HomeAddressRepeat",
        "language": "text/fhirpath",
        "expression": "%patient.address.where(use='home' and (type.empty() or type!='postal'))" // %patient is a reference to a launchContext patient resource
      }
    }
  ],
  "linkId": "home-address-repeat-group",
  "type": "group",
  "repeats": true,
  "item": [
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
          "valueExpression": {
            "language": "text/fhirpath",
            "expression": "%HomeAddressRepeat.select(line.join(', '))"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "street-address",
      "definition": "http://hl7.org.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/au-address#Address.line",
      "text": "Street address",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
          "valueExpression": {
            "language": "text/fhirpath",
            "expression": "%HomeAddressRepeat.city"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "city",
      "definition": "http://hl7.org.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/au-address#Address.city",
      "text": "City",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
          "valueExpression": {
            "language": "text/fhirpath",
            "expression": "%HomeAddressRepeat.state"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "state",
      "definition": "http://hl7.org.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/au-address#Address.state",
      "text": "State",
      "type": "choice",
      "answerValueSet": "https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/australian-states-territories-2"
    },
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaire-initialExpression",
          "valueExpression": {
            "language": "text/fhirpath",
            "expression": "%HomeAddressRepeat.postalCode"
          }
        }
      ],
      "linkId": "postcode",
      "definition": "http://hl7.org.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/au-address#Address.postalCode",
      "text": "Postcode",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Initial

Allows one or more values to be pre-filled in the answer when initially rendering the questionnaire for user input. Initial values can't be specified for groups or display items.

This uses answers defined in the questionnaire itself, instead of relying on a FHIR server to provide the initial values.

Questions using answerOption can use `answerOption.initialSelected` as an alternative.

:::note

Multiple initial values can be used in repeating items. There can only be one initial value for non-repeating items.

### InitialExpression

Allows one or more values to be pre-filled in the answer by evaluating its expression when it goes through the pre-population process.

It relies on a source FHIR server, extensions defining pre-population queries i.e. launchContext, x-fhir-query variables, sourceQueries or itemPopulationContext, as well as FHIRPath evaluation to provide the initial values.

For more information, refer to http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#initialExpression.

#### Basic Usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="component-sdc-12-form-population--initial-expression"
  initialHeight={144}
/>

Besides this basic usage, all the usage examples on this page utilizes InitialExpressions for pre-population.

### CalculatedExpression

CalculatedExpressions can be used in conjunction with InitialExpressions to calculate a value based on the initial values provided.

For information related to using calculatedExpressions without pre-population, refer to [Calculations](/docs/sdc/calculations#calculatedexpression).

In the two usage examples below, the final result i.e. BMI and CVD risk score are calculated based on the pre-populated initial values.
