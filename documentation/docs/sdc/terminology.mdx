# Terminology Binding

Standardised terminology can be used in FHIR Questionnaires via [codes](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/terminologies.html) and [valueSets](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset.html) for interoperability purposes.

The elements/extensions that fall under this category are:

- [answerOption](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#answerOption)
- [answerValueSet](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#answerValueSet)
- [answerExpression](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#answerExpression)

:::note

These three mechanisms are mutually exclusive. Only one should appear on the same item.

Not all components support terminology binding. The following components support Not all components support calculated expressions. The following components support calculated expressions::

### AnswerOption

AnswerOption is used to specify a list of possible answers to a question. Each answer can be represented by a **integer**, **date**, **time**, **string**, **Coding** or **Reference** element.

AnswerOption provides a way to initially set answer(s) as selected for a question via `answerOption.initialSelected`. However, multiple initial selections can only be used in repeating items. There can only be one initial selected value for non-repeating items.

### AnswerValueSet

AnswerValueSet allows a set of codes in a code system within a [valueSet](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset.html) to be used as a set of possible answers to a question.
It also allows for the possibility of sharing a set of answers across multiple items within a single Questionnaire.

There are two ways to define an answerValueSet:

1. Referencing a ValueSet URL

```
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  // ...
  "item": [
    {
      // ...
      "answerValueSet": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Referencing a ValueSet defined in a [contained resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/references.html#contained)

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  // ...
  "contained": [
    {
      "resourceType": "ValueSet",
      "id": "example-value-set",
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
      // ...
      "expansion": [
        {
          "contains": [
            {
              "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
              "code": "code-1",
              "display": "display-1"
            },
            {
              "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
              "code": "code-2",
              "display": "display-2"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "item": [
    {
      // ...
      "answerValueSet": "#example-value-set"
    }
  ]
}
```
