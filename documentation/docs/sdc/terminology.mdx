# Terminology Binding

Standardised terminology can be used in FHIR Questionnaires via [codes](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/terminologies.html) and [valueSets](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset.html) for interoperability purposes.

The elements/extensions that fall under this category are:

- [answerOption](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#answerOption)
- [answerValueSet](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#answerValueSet)
- [answerExpression](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/expressions.html#answerExpression)

Other related extensions:

- [unitOption](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/behavior.html#unitOption) - Provide selection choices for the unit of a quantity item
- [preferredTerminologyServer](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-preferredTerminologyServer.html) - Specify the preferred terminology server to use for terminology requests

:::note

The three mechanisms (answerOption, answerValueSet and answerExpression) are mutually exclusive. Only one should appear on the same item.

:::
Not all components support terminology binding. Only the following components support terminology binding:

| Components                |
| ------------------------- |
| choice                    |
| open-choice               |
| quantity (via unitOption) |

### AnswerOption

AnswerOption is used to specify a list of possible answers to a question. Each answer can be represented by a **integer**, **date**, **time**, **string**, **Coding** or **Reference** element.

AnswerOption provides a way to initially set answer(s) as selected for a question via `answerOption.initialSelected`. However, multiple initial selections can only be used in repeating items. There can only be one initial selected value for non-repeating items.

#### Usages

View usages in [Component's choice/open-choice sections](/docs/components/choice) and the [SDC Advanced Question section](/docs/sdc/advanced/question).

### AnswerValueSet

AnswerValueSet allows a set of codes in a code system within a [valueSet](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset.html) to be used as a set of possible answers to a question.
It also allows for the possibility of sharing a set of answers across multiple items within a single Questionnaire.

There are two ways to define an answerValueSet:

1. Referencing a ValueSet URL

```
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  // ...
  "item": [
    {
      // ...
      "answerValueSet": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Referencing a ValueSet defined in a [contained resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/references.html#contained)

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
  // ...
  "contained": [
    {
      "resourceType": "ValueSet",
      "id": "example-value-set",
      "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
      // ...
      "expansion": [
        {
          "contains": [
            {
              "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
              "code": "code-1",
              "display": "display-1"
            },
            {
              "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-valueSet",
              "code": "code-2",
              "display": "display-2"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "item": [
    {
      // ...
      "answerValueSet": "#example-value-set"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Usages

View usages in [Component's choice/open-choice sections](/docs/components/choice) and the [SDC Advanced Question section](/docs/sdc/advanced/question).

### AnswerExpression

Allows specifying a FHIR Query or FHIRPath that resolves to be used as a set of possible answers to a question.

:::warning

Support for this extension is not thoroughly tested yet.

:::

#### Basic usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-10-1-2-behavior-choice-restriction--answer-expression"
  initialHeight={280}
/>

### UnitOption

UnitOption is used to specify a list of possible units to a [Quantity](/docs/components/quantity) question.

This can be used when the unit is not fixed, and allows the user to choose from a list of units.

#### With multiple unitOptions

<IframeContainer storyId="itemtype-quantity--quantity-unit-option-multi" initialHeight={280} />

#### With a single unitOption

:::tip

It is recommended to use the "questionnaire-unit" extension instead when there is only one unit to choose from.

:::

<IframeContainer storyId="itemtype-quantity--quantity-unit-option-single" initialHeight={280} />

### PreferredTerminologyServer

PreferredTerminologyServer is used to specify the preferred terminology server to use for terminology requests associated with the whole questionnaire or a particular group or question within the questionnaire (depending on where the extension appears).

#### Basic usage

<IframeContainer
  storyId="sdc-9-1-4-rendering-other--preferred-terminology-server"
  initialHeight={280}
/>
