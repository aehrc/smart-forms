# Structured Data Capture

Smart Forms is built as a reference implementation of the [Structured Data Capture](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc) FHIR specification, and is based on R4 FHIR.

The SDC specification provides a set of guidance around the use of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse that support many additional capabilities that provide benefits to providers, patients and other users.

Before diving into this section, it might be worth reading the [usage examples guide](/docs/components#usage-examples-guide) in the Components section.

## Conformance Checklist

The SDC specification is huge, therefore Smart Forms does not cover all of it. Below is a quick conformance checklist of what is supported currently.

To see the detailed list of what is supported by a Questionnaire item type, please refer to the specific item types in [Components](/docs/components).

## Form Population

View the page here: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/populate.html

**Population operations**

- [x] $populate
- [ ] $populate-html
- [ ] $populate-link

Smart Forms only supports **full population** at the moment, and SMART App Launch is a requirement. Only patient, practitioner and encounter launch contexts are supported.

**Population mechanisms**

- [ ] Observation-based
- [x] Expression-based
- [ ] StructureMap-based

While StructuredMap-based population mechanism is not supported, [sdc-questionnaire-sourceQueries](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-sourceQueries.html) is supported, using an expression-based approach.

## Form Data Extraction

View the page here: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/extraction.html

This is something we are super interested in, but haven't quite got to it yet.

## Modular Forms

View the page here: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/modular.html#modular-questionnaires

Our Forms Server https://smartforms.csiro.au/api/fhir supports the [$assemble](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/OperationDefinition-Questionnaire-assemble.html) operation.
The implementation is based on http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/modular.html#modular-questionnaires.

## Adaptive Forms

View the page here: http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/adaptive.html

This is not something on our radar at the moment :(

## Custom Extensions

Smart Forms includes several custom extensions that provide additional functionality beyond the standard SDC extensions.

### Questionnaire Item Text Hidden

- [x] QuestionnaireItemTextHidden

Allows hiding the text label of questionnaire items from the UI. Useful for internal fields that don't need user-facing labels.

**Usage:**

- When `valueBoolean: true`, the item text is hidden from the UI
- When `valueBoolean: false` or extension is not present, the text is visible
- The extension must be placed in the `_text.extension` property of the questionnaire item

**Benefits:**

- Hide internal fields that shouldn't be visible to users
- Create cleaner UI by hiding unnecessary labels
- Support use cases where field labels are not needed

### Group Hide Add Item Button

- [x] GroupHideAddItemButton

Allows hiding the "Add Item" button for repeating groups and group tables. Useful for static tables where users shouldn't be allowed to add new rows.

**Usage:**

- When `valueBoolean: true`, the "Add Item" button is hidden
- When `valueBoolean: false` or extension is not present, the button is visible
- The extension must be placed in the `extension` property of the questionnaire item

**Benefits:**

- Create static tables that users cannot modify
- Prevent accidental addition of rows to structured data
- Provide better control over form behavior

### Questionnaire Initial Expression Repopulatable

- [x] questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable

Allows individual fields to be manually repopulated with fresh data from the FHIR server. Provides granular control over data synchronization without affecting the entire form.

**Usage:**

- When `valueCode: 'manual'`, a sync button appears next to the field
- The field must also have an `initialExpression` extension to be repopulatable
- Clicking the sync button will re-evaluate the initial expression and update the field value

**Requirements:**

- The field must have both `initialExpression` and `questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable` extensions
- The `questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable` extension must have `valueCode: 'manual'`
- The form must be pre-populated to see the repopulate buttons

**Benefits:**

- Granular repopulation of individual fields without affecting the entire form
- Allows users to refresh specific data points when needed
- Provides fine-grained control over data synchronization
