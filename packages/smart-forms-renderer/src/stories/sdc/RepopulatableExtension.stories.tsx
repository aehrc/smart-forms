This story demonstrates the custom questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable extension that allows individual fields to be manually repopulated with fresh data from the FHIR server.

**Extension URL:** \`https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable\`

**Usage:**
- When \`valueCode: 'manual'\`, a sync button appears next to the field
- The field must also have an \`initialExpression\` extension to be repopulatable
- Clicking the sync button will re-evaluate the initial expression and update the field value

**Benefits:**
- Granular repopulation of individual fields without affecting the entire form
- Allows users to refresh specific data points when needed
- Provides fine-grained control over data synchronization

**Requirements:**
- The field must have both \`initialExpression\` and \`questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable\` extensions
- The \`questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable\` extension must have \`valueCode: 'manual'\`
- The form must be pre-populated to see the repopulate buttons

This form shows several fields with repopulate buttons:
1. Patient Name - Repopulated from patient data
2. Patient Age - Calculated from birth date
3. Patient Gender - From patient gender field
4. BMI - Static value (for demonstration)
5. Blood Pressure - Static value (for demonstration)
6. Normal Field - Has initial expression but no repopulate button

This form demonstrates the questionnaire-initialExpression-repopulatable extension in action:

**Patient Information Section:**
- **Patient Name** - Shows sync button, repopulates from patient data
- **Patient Age** - Shows sync button, calculates age from birth date
- **Patient Gender** - Shows sync button, repopulates from patient gender

**Medical Information Section:**
- **BMI** - Shows sync button, repopulates with static value
- **Blood Pressure** - Shows sync button, repopulates with static value
- **Normal Field** - No sync button (has initial expression but no repopulate extension)

**Try this:**
1. Click the "Pre-populate" button to populate the form with initial data
2. Notice the sync buttons (ðŸ”„) appear next to repopulatable fields
3. Modify some field values manually
4. Click the sync buttons to repopulate individual fields
5. Notice that only the clicked field gets updated, not the entire form

**Note:** The repopulate buttons only appear after the form has been pre-populated and the fields have initial expressions with the repopulatable extension.
