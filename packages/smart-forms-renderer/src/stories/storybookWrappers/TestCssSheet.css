/* This stylesheet is using for testing the RenderingXhtmlGroupPropagationClassStyles story, it has no other use outside of this.
 * It works by having a class defined in the XHTML, where the class references external styles from a stylesheet.
 * Please import the stylesheet where you call the <BaseRenderer/> component.
 *
 * NOTE before using:
 * The renderer support this, but it is recommended to define the styles inline in the XHTML.
 * Using external styles means that the Questionnaire itself is not self-contained and the stylings are almost guaranteed to not work in other SDC implementations.
 * For accurate guidance, see https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/narrative.html#:~:text=Authoring%20systems%20may,approach%20with%20care.
